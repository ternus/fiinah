          <p>Sorry, the respondent cannot answer your question. External constraints prevent them from disclosing any information regarding this topic -- including whether or not they know the answer.</p>

<p>The answer may well be perfectly innocent, in which case the respondent is protecting their ability to avoid disclosing such information in the future. (Imagine you asked several questions and got "No", "No", "No", and "I can't tell you" -- what would you learn from that?)</p>

<p>This is derived from the game Continuum, in which the <a href="http://www.aetherco.com/continuum/glossary.html">glossary</a> gives this definition:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This phrase is used whenever an informative answer cannot be
given... on the understanding that knowing too much or too little
can be burdensome... The sentence is perfectly information-neutral,
revealing only that additional information on the subject matter the
querant seeks will not be found at that place and timeâ€“ not whether
the respondant knows or doesn't know the answer, nor any clue to its
discovery or relevance.</p>
