    <div id="explanation">
      <p>Sorry, the respondent cannot answer your question. External constraints 
	prevent them from disclosing any information regarding this
	topic -- including whether or not they know the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
	The answer may well be perfectly innocent, in which case the
	responder is protecting their ability to avoid disclosing such
	information in the future. (Imagine you asked several
	questions and got "No" and "I can't tell you" -- what would
	you learn from that?)
      </p>


      <p>This is derived from the game Continuum,
	in which the <a href="http://www.aetherco.com/continuum/glossary.html">glossary</a>
	gives this definition:
	<quote>
	  This phrase is used whenever an informative answer cannot be
	  given... on the understanding that knowing too much or too little
	  can be burdensome... The sentence is perfectly information-neutral,
	  revealing only that additional information on the subject matter the
	  querant seeks will not be found at that place and timeâ€“ not whether
	  the respondant knows or doesn't know the answer, nor any clue to its
	  discovery or relevance.
