External constraints prevent them from disclosing any information regarding this topic -- including whether or not they know the answer.\r\n\r\nThe answer may well be perfectly innocent, in which case the respondent is protecting their ability to avoid disclosing such information in the future.

The sentence is perfectly information-neutral,\r\n> revealing only that additional information on the subject matter the\r\n> querant seeks will not be found at that place and timeâ€“ not whether\r\n> the respondant knows or doesn't know the answer, nor any clue to its\r\n> discovery or relevance.\r\n\r\nCreated by [@ternus](http://twitter.com/ternus)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
